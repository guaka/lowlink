**lowlink.py** will recursively create lowercase symbolic links to
files with capitals. This can be useful when migrating from a case insensitive system to a case sensitive system, e.g.
when converting a website from ASP on Windows to Drupal on LAMP.

This script was developed by [Kasper Souren](http://guaka.org/) for migrating [B'Tselem](http://www.btselem.org/) to Drupal.
